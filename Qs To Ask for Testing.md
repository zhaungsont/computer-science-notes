Transitioning from React to Vue and diving into unit testing for the first time can seem daunting, but it's a valuable skill set to develop. Here are some questions you might consider asking your manager to get more clarity on your task:

1. **Scope & Codebase Familiarity**:
    - "Can I get access to the repository or codebase where the Vue.js application is stored?"
    - "Are there specific components or features that are a priority for testing, or should I start with the entire application?"
    - "Is there any existing test suite or any tests already written for this codebase?"

2. **Testing Tools & Libraries**:
    - "Are there any specific testing libraries or tools you'd like me to use? For example, Vue Test Utils, Jest, Mocha, etc.?"
    - "Is there a preferred testing strategy or methodology I should follow?"

3. **Functional Requirements**:
    - "Do we have documented functional requirements or user stories that I can use as a reference while writing tests?"
    - "Should I focus on unit tests alone, or are integration and end-to-end tests also part of the scope?"

4. **Mocking & Stubs**:
    - "How do we handle external dependencies, like API calls? Do we have tools or preferred practices for mocking or stubbing these out?"

5. **Configuration & Setup**:
    - "Is there a standard setup or configuration for testing environments in the organization?"
    - "How should I handle testing data? Are there any tools or databases in place for this?"

6. **Coverage & Metrics**:
    - "What level of code coverage are we aiming for with these unit tests?"
    - "Are there any metrics or quality benchmarks I should be aware of while testing?"

7. **Collaboration**:
    - "Who can I collaborate with if I have specific questions about the Vue.js codebase or its functionality?"
    - "Are there regular code reviews or check-ins regarding the tests I'll be writing?"

8. **Documentation & Learning Resources**:
    - "Is there any existing documentation about the project that could help me get started?"
    - "Do you have recommendations on resources or tutorials specific to Vue.js testing that might help me ramp up faster?"

9. **Timeline & Deadlines**:
    - "Is there a specific timeline or deadline for when these unit tests should be completed?"
    - "Should I provide regular updates on my progress?"

10. **Post-Testing Procedures**:
    - "Once the unit tests are written, what's the next step? Is there a CI/CD process I should be integrating them into?"
    - "How do we handle failed tests or bugs that are discovered during testing?"

Remember, there's no harm in asking questions, especially when you're stepping into new territory. It's a sign that you're proactive and looking to handle your tasks effectively. Good luck with your testing journey!
